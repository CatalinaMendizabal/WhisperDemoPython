# Virtual Assistant for Clinic History Formatting

## Description

This Python project is a Virtual Assistant designed to help healthcare professionals format clinic history records efficiently. The Virtual Assistant uses OpenAI's language processing capabilities for Voice-to-Text translation and incorporates specific call functions to generate formatted clinic history records.

The primary goal of this project is to assist medical professionals in documenting patient information accurately and saving time in the process. It converts spoken patient details into a structured format that can be easily integrated into electronic health record systems or printed as clinic history reports.

## Features

- **Voice-to-Text Translation:** The Virtual Assistant uses OpenAI's language model to transcribe spoken input from medical professionals and converts it into text.

- **Clinic History Formatting:** After translating the voice input, the Assistant applies specific formatting rules to structure the clinic history, including patient details, medical history, diagnosis, treatment, and other relevant sections.

- **User-friendly Interface:** The project provides a user-friendly interface that allows medical professionals to interact with the Virtual Assistant easily.

- **Customizable Templates:** The Assistant supports customizable clinic history templates, allowing users to tailor the format according to their specific requirements.
